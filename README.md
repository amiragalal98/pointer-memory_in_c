# pointer-memory_in_c

The base unit of memory is a byte.
Memory is represented as a block of bytes.
These bytes have an associated address which is represented by a hexadecimal number.
When a program is running, it is the responsibility of the underlying operating system to reserve a block of RAM for the program.
A pointer is a special type of integer variable that stores the memory address of a regular variable.
A pointer can store the address of any type of variable, including other pointers.
The address stored in a pointer is the address of the first byte of memory that stores a variable.
A pointer can be declared in two ways:
dataType* nameOfPointer;
dataType *nameOfPointer;
To obtain the address of a variable such that it may be assigned to a pointer, the reference operator (&) is used. Syntax:
&variableName;
Accessing data that is stored in a memory address pointed to by a pointer is done using the dereference operator (*). Syntax:
*pointerName
Pointer arithmetic is allowed but only for addition and subtraction by an integer.
It is not possible to add/subtract one pointer to/from another pointer.
Incrementing or decrementing a pointer is done in the following way:
pointer += someInteger;
pointer -= someInteger;
Incrementing/decrementing a pointer changes the address by n times the size of the data type the pointer is pointing to.
Because an array is stored as a contiguous block of memory, a pointer can be used to traverse it.
Great care must be exercised when using a pointer as it is possible to accidentally corrupt data stored in other memory addresses.
